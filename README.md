1.The project focuses on the development of an autonomous system for identifying and deterring unauthorized mobile targets based on their color.
The system:
- Is based on a mobile robot equipped with a camera.
- Can identify targets in the field under both light and dark conditions.
- Aims the camera at the detected targets.
- Reports the threat via a message to a mobile phone.
- Alerts the target both vocally and visually.
- Includes a flashlight that simulates an antenna for jamming communication frequencies, enabling the system to disrupt control of the target and neutralize it autonomously.
